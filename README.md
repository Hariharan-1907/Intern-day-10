# Intern-day-10
"On Day 10 of my internship, I added a footer section to my website. The footer includes important links, copyright information, and social media icons. Designed using HTML and CSS, it is responsive and enhances the overall website structure. Future improvements may include JavaScript for dynamic content and interactive elements."
